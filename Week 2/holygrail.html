                <p>Basketball culture has the power to move the world forward. For Jordan Brand, no one has embodied the potential of the game quite like Howard “H” White – the inimitable legend and mentor who has helped Air Jordan (and countless others around the world) take flight. He's now Vice President of Jordan Brand Affairs, as well as a co-creator of Jordan Brand Wings. To honor H’s impact on the brand and the global community of basketball, Jordan Brand is releasing the limited-edition Air Jordan 2 “H” Wings inspired by his storied career.</p>
